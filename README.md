# swift-commandLine-demo

to run in xcode console: use global file path WITHOUT QUOTES as input (/Users/this-guy/code/demo/sample.json)<br />
it does NOT account for tildes<br /><br />

when running the compiled executable you can give it the local file extension (ie, if cwd is demo/, just input sample.json)
