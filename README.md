# swift-commandLine-demo

to run in xcode console: use global file path as input (/Users/this-guy/code/demo/sample.json) -- it doesn't account for tildes
when running the compiled executable you can give it the local file extension (ie, if cwd is demo/, just input sample.json)
doesn't account for quotes around file locations! :)
